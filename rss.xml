        <description><![CDATA[Exploring how good design is recognized, and favored by human eyes.]]></description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered why most companies do a rebrand every few years, out of the blue, completely unprompted? The design team certainly does not just wake up someday and go, &quot;yeah we should just redesign our identity.&quot;</p>
<p>There must be a reason to it, because humans by nature don&#39;t like change. Unless it&#39;s good.</p>

<h2>Why we usually agree on Good Design</h2>
<p>Good design is simple. It&#39;s elegant, and most importantly, it&#39;s relevant. Take a look at Chrome&#39;s early design and what we have now. It&#39;s a drastic change in the span of a decade. But if we were living in a timeline where Chrome&#39;s logo stayed at its 2008 variant, people will not be happy.</p>
<p>The old Chrome logo was bold, shiny, full of 3D effects and metallic glow that screamed &quot;cutting-edge tech&quot; in the era of skeuomorphism. But as design trends shifted toward simpler, minimalist interfaces (think Material Design), that glossy look starts to feel dated. This is why most apps, companies and even plain designs shift to those trends. Because you usually don&#39;t want to be the odd one out.</p>
<p>We accept (and even celebrate) those changes because good design evolves with us. It mirrors cultural shifts, technological advancements, and our changing tastes.</p>
<p>Or, in more american terms:

<h2>Judging covers</h2>
<p>The phrase &quot;don&#39;t judge a book by its cover&quot; is great advice. Until it isn&#39;t.
Our brains are wired for quick visual judgements, and that&#39;s okay, because usually our brains are right. Humans form first impressions in milliseconds. In a world full of choices, we rely on heuristics to decide what&#39;s actually worth our attention. Color, symmetry, simplicity, and relevance. Good design just taps into this by feeling intuitive and easy on the eyes.</p>
<p>Bad design on the other hand creates friction. Cluttered layouts, mismatched fonts, or outdated styles make us subconsciously think, &quot;This feels cheap.&quot; Even if it really isn&#39;t. </p>
<p>That&#39;s why a beautifully typeset, (literal) book cover makes us assume the story inside is worth reading.</p>

<h2>Design is everywhere</h2>
<p>Whatever you&#39;re doing in life, you most certainly make design choices everyday. If you&#39;re a writer, fonts, spacing and page design matters. If you&#39;re a developer, clean code matters, UI matters, those promote good Developer Experience, <em>and</em> User Experience. And if you&#39;re the guy behind IKEA, whatever you&#39;re doing is probably good.</p>
<p>The point: design isn&#39;t a separate skill; it&#39;s how we organize intention. And it&#39;s easier to start than you think. Put your thoughts on screen (or paper, or canvas), iterate, and refine. But most importantly, ask yourself: How does it look to <em>you</em>? If you like it, good chance is, everyone else will.</p>
<p>We judge covers because good design isn&#39;t superficial - it&#39;s a shortcut to trust, efficiency, and pleasure. Whether logos, books, UIs, or code, clean symmetry wins because our brains are built to love it.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[Addressing the elephant in the room.]]></description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence is the defining topic of our current moment. Some believe it&#39;s a &quot;bubble,&quot; while others think it’s a drop-in replacement for search engines.
I believe it&#39;s neither.</p>
<p>But I do believe it is the next &quot;big thing.&quot;</p>
<h2>A look back on other &quot;big things&quot;</h2>
<p>Technological paradigms are constantly shifting. The &quot;hype&quot; cycle surrounding new technology has existed for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_technology">really long time</a>.</p>
<p>I grew up as the internet was becoming mainstream. Websites were popping up everywhere; it was the hot topic. I’m certain there was a  good few back then who thought the internet was a bubble that would never replace traditional media. That didn&#39;t age well.</p>
<p>I also remember when mobile phones began to saturate the market. This one is tricky, as phones had existed in various forms for a while. But when the smartphone arrived, it changed everything - first for the tech-savvys, and eventually for everyone.</p>
<p>Then came social media, streaming platforms, and so on.</p>
<p>We are always looking for the next big thing; it&#39;s in our nature. And sooner or later, those big things usually do come around.</p>
<h2>Why AI?</h2>
<p>Like most previous paradigm shifts, AI is not technically new. It has existed for decades, but only recently has it become accessible to the masses. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>However, AI has grown in availability and usability at an unprecedented rate. ChatGPT was officially released in late 2022; I&#39;m writing this in late 2025. In just three years, it jumped from a conversational bot to a full-fledged multimodal agentic system capable of complex execution.</p>
<p>This rate of growth is unusual, to say the least. Mobile phones and internet took their sweet time to reach that &quot;mainstream&quot; status. AI is already there. It has been there for a while, and that, while seemingly exciting, is also terrifying.</p>
<h2>The elephant in the room</h2>
<p><img src="/content/blog/ai/elephant.png" alt="The elephant in the room">
AI is here to stay. It&#39;s not going away, and it&#39;s not a bubble. It&#39;s the next big thing.
And this is, in layman&#39;s terms, really bad.</p>
<p>To understand why this is bad, let&#39;s take a look at the impact of each previous big thing, and yes, order matters.</p>
<p><strong>Telephones</strong> made communication easier, faster, and more accessible. While this sounds dreamy, it also reduced physical proximity. It wasn&#39;t horrible, but it was a start.</p>
<p><strong>The Internet</strong> made information accessible to everyone. It shrunk the world. However, it made <em>all</em> information accessible to <em>everyone</em>. One could argue this wasn&#39;t a huge problem when the user base was primarily adults and professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Smartphones</strong> made the internet universally accessible. Suddenly, everyone could get online, anytime, anywhere. Access no longer required a public library or a home computer. This is where things became complicated.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong> was the cherry on top. We didn&#39;t just have easily accessible information; we had platforms built on the premise of constant engagement. Accessing information was no longer a passive act.</p>
<p>This trend of compounding impacts should give you an idea of what I&#39;m hinting at. I believe that every new &quot;big thing&quot; is more dangerous than the one before it. Why? Simply because every new technology is the accumulation of all previous ones: their good, their bad, and their ugly.</p>
<h2>Is it over?</h2>
<p>We are tripling our carbon footprint, consuming water at alarming rates, and building massive data centers, all while making it more difficult for the average user to keep up with hardware demands. Yet, we are not <em>entirely</em> doomed.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t hate AI. In fact, I was an early supporter. I used to be fascinated by early NLP models; Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Google Now, you name it. I loved the idea of talking to a machine and having it understand. This fascination is also probably the reason behind my interest in video games. Later, I dove into the theory of machine learning and deep learning, following new architectures as they emerged, but this was all just theory. Then came LLMs.</p>
<p>I am torn on Large Language Models (LLMs). I love them; I think they&#39;re incredible tools for routine work and brainstorming. But a little too much of a good thing can be bad. LLMs should never be a replacement for you.</p>
<p>Your brain is the most powerful system to ever exist. It&#39;s the definition of general intelligence. It&#39;s what any AI is trying to mimic. But it simply can&#39;t. Not yet, and likely never. </p>
<p>They&#39;re called &quot;co-pilots&quot; for a reason. We shouldn&#39;t let them replace education, critical thinking, and creativity. Because if we do, we&#39;ll be effectively devolving as humans. </p>
<p>One of my all time favorite quotes that pretty much sums all this up is author <a href="https://x.com/AuthorJMac">@AuthorJMac</a>&#39;s tweet:</p>
