You believe you're seeing reality. Making rational decisions. Controlling your life. But the fact is, your brain is *constantly* lying to you. And that's a good thing.

## Your "Reality" is a guessing game

Your brain doesn’t work like a camera.

It doesn’t record reality and play it back. It predicts what’s out there, based on past experience, incomplete sensory data, and a lot of shortcuts.

Light hits your eyes.
Sound hits your ears.
And then your brain fills in the rest.

Colors? Not really “out there.”
They’re interpretations.

Objects? Your brain stitches edges together and decides what counts as a thing.

Even the smooth feeling of time flowing forward? That’s a construction too.

Your ancestors didn’t need perfect accuracy. They needed fast guesses.
Is that a snake or a stick?
Friend or threat?

Hesitation was expensive.

## Dreams prove the point

I've always found dreams really fascinating. Every night, your brain runs a full simulation with zero external input.

No light.
No sound.
No real body movement.

And yet... you see. You hear. You feel fear, joy, embarrassment. You talk to people who aren’t there. It all feels *real*.

Apparently, our brains don't need the outside world to create a convincing one. It's all about patterns..

      --themed-svg-aspect: 2816.07 / 732.97;

  ></div>

Dreams are what happens when our brain goes offline from reality and keeps doing what it does best: predictions, storytelling, and emotion.

Walking life is the same thing, just with live data plugged in.

## Feelings run the show

We like to think we're logical creatures. We're not.

We're emotional systems that occassionally do math. Your brain uses feelings as shortcuts. Good or bad. Safe or risky. Familiar or strange. Logic usually comes later, if all.

That’s why dreams stick with you emotionally even when they make no sense.
The plot doesn’t matter. The feeling does.

Your brain cares about what matters, not what’s tidy.
This is a pivotal point for the way brains are wired, from our early age. But this is a topic for another time.

## You think you're in control. You're mostly not.

"Decision-making" is hoax. A lot of decisions start before you're consciously aware of them. Your brain commits, then your conscious mind shows up to explain why it "chose" that option.

One of my favorite manifestations of this is the fact that if you're deciding between two things, and toss a coin, you'll actually make your decision before the coin lands. The coin flip is merely a spur.

  <div
    class="themed-svg"
    role="img"
    aria-label="Coin toss visual"
    style="
      --themed-svg-url: url('/content/blog/brain/toss.svg');
      --themed-svg-aspect: 1981.12 / 802.93;
    "
  ></div>

Many such cases;
You feel hungry *after* your body decides it needs food.
You reach for your phone *before* you notice boredom.
You say something, then you instantly justify it for yourself.

This is more helpful than you think, imagine if you had to consciously approve every tiny action before doing it. You'd never get anything done.

## Your brain wasn't built for this world

All of these tricks evolved in a slow, small, social environment.

Not infinite scrolling.
Not constant notifications.
Not global comparison with millions of strangers.

Your brain is still running old software:

- Attention locks onto novelty and threat
- Social rejection feels like physical pain
- Certainty feels better than nuance

Modern life pushes all the wrong buttons, all the time.

## So why is this actually good?

Because the same system that bends reality also gives you **imagination**, it gives you **creativity**, it gives you **empathy**. It gives you the ability to **learn**, **adapt**, and **invent** futures that don’t exist yet. 

It's also the same talented, complex system that comes up with **dreams**, **stories**, **art**, and **science**.

If your brain only showed you cold, objective reality, you wouldn’t be human.
You’d be a sensor.

Understanding that your brain lies doesn’t mean you can turn it off.
It means you can stop blindly trusting every thought, fear, or impulse it throws at you.

You’re not broken.
You’re running a very clever, very old system.

And once you see the illusion, you can work with it instead of against it.

That’s the real upgrade.
